For me, that was the 2021. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say i\u0026rsquo;ve grown up because of this year, i wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say i\u0026rsquo;ve even growth up at all. but wait what it even means growing up at all? isn\u0026rsquo;t that happening everyday? isn\u0026rsquo;t that how time and our physical body works? I do have my own answer. It would be a different answers or no answer at all if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for the book I read(there are also my other real life experience that helped but i will not mention it in this article). Anyway this aritcle the books that i read in 2021 that shape the way i think.\nLike myself overconfident in my cooking skill(until the lastest time i cooked for one of my friend), i also overconfident about the book i read(i feel sorry for friends who have a meal which i cook). I love giving book recommendation. I think i myself got changed by these exciting book so i want share the same things to my friends. i\u0026rsquo;m the guys who \u0026ldquo;hey check this book out it will change your life\u0026rdquo; although i only started like the first 20 page of that book. this happens everytimes i read the a book that have rousing or inspiring opening and the customer of my book envangeling was my two close friends.\nAs time progress, i restrained myself. not because that two friends didn\u0026rsquo;t pay attention to the recommendation i gave but because i relize what i enjoy reading and others was so diffferent based on our experience, the problem we are facing, our expectation when reading the book. when one of those friend recommend me the book i couldn\u0026rsquo;t urge myself that book anyway so this also strengthen my believe about why i should restrain myself from giving book recommendation.\nThat being so, i didn\u0026rsquo;t want this list to be a book recommendation. but a self relfection on what i read. These are the book that shape the way i think, grow me as explorer of life answering the questions i\u0026rsquo;m still having no final answer.\nwhat book I read and how i consider a book good for me there are two kinds of book: book about skill and book about philosophy. for a book to be about skill, mostly they are about technical lesson, specific way of how to do some things, science, programming or mathematics book, with the lesson i learn from these book they are like investment in which the time i spent would give me return in the future, or the job. about philosophy books like novels, . i think these are should be 2 spectrum, one book can lie among these two and the difference in degree can be big or small or equal.\nhow i find what book to read\nbooks already been proofed by time, social or authority: books i read will be based on the age of the book, how reading community react, what famous peole, like Elon musk, enthusaically recommend. the way i read book, i use the 80/20 rule also the economic concept opportnity cost into my reading style. these two are that some books would follow 80/20 rules which means 80% of the golden idea can be found in 20% of the content,the rest is just dragging on, also reading this one book i\u0026rsquo;m using my times not reading another book. which mean with these 2 ideas i would think it like by reading 40% of the two books i could have it like 160% golden idea compare to reading 100% percent of 1 book. so well i\u0026rsquo;m a skiper, or you in a formal way a skim reader. but not every book i think i can use these 2 ideas to speed up the process, definitely can\u0026rsquo;t do that with a novel. so basically books i considered good:\nskill book explain ideas clearly, the ideas are organized in a good logical way book that give me at least one idea that \u0026ldquo;change\u0026rdquo; how i see people and the world i\u0026rsquo;m living in book that take me out of my real geographical place, chronological time, or it let me travel into someone else mind Based on these principle, if you think there are some books I’d find exciting, please feel free to give recommendations. I’d love to read the books that shaped you too.\nThe books that changed the way I see the world and my place in it for now i cannot do review like this must reread each book a more sophisticated review\nMan\u0026rsquo;s Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl “Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.”\nGendered Lives by Julia T. Wood, Natalie Fixmer-Oraiz i my list i would recommend many text book and this is one of them. before reading this book, i didn\u0026rsquo;t have a view of how men and women are different, i simply think if they are different it is because the human minds this person are different from that person not this gender are different from that gender. But this book just reeducate me on the idea. i also have another look at gender, gender is not same as sex, also it is shaped by the culture, biology traits of the body and the brain, for many people this is obvious but for me this book really show me a new perspective about human life.\nself-determination a book on motivation, it break down the whole abstract words motivation into something concrete and for that i can measure it for myself. this book also give my new ability in how i access how human including myself motivated.\nzero to one this book is not just for entrepreneur but everyone including people who working for company or just want to be financially stable i think\nthe 48 laws of power stumbling on hapiness social animal daring greatly little prince essential manners for men emotional intelligence elon musk The books that gave me precious skills and practical ideas the lean start up how to read element of style style basics of clarity and grace cook\u0026rsquo;s the science of good cooking salt fat acid heat\ndiscrete math sql cook book pyton data science handbook python for everyone - the linux commandline creating blog with jekyll the programming C language hitchhiker guide to python common sense guide to data structure and algorithms college essay how to talk to anyone talk like ted the 7 habits of highly effective people the art of clean code books that i\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to categorize this but it\u0026rsquo;s entertaining infintie power how calculus reveals the scret of the universe how i read books that i read if you\u0026rsquo;re confidence enough about your reading taste you can also suggest me some good books down below the comment.\n","permalink":"https://qvieth.github.io/posts/new/","summary":"book that shape my 2021","title":"The books that shape my 2021"}]
